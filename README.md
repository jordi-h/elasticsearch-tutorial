# elasticsearch-tutorial

With the continuous growth of Internet usage and data proliferation in the contemporary era, the need for efficient data solutions has become increasingly critical, contributing to the rapid expansion of this field. Traditional database management systems, while having been the preferred choice for decades, may face challenges in managing the substantial volumes of structured or unstructured data generated daily.

NoSQL databases, offering flexibility, scalability, and high performance, have emerged in response to these evolving market requirements. They are designed to handle large data sets characteristic of the current digital landscape.
Of the various types of NoSQL databases, document-oriented databases have attracted notable interest due to their proficiency in managing diverse data formats. **Elasticsearch**, an open-source full-text search and analytics engine, and a document-oriented NoSQL database management system aligns with these specifications, positioning it as a robust tool in the current data ecosystem.

## Content
This repository consists of two distinct, tutorial-based components:
1. A tutorial presented as a scholarly paper, accompanied by a complementary Jupyter Notebook.
2. A tutorial designed as a slide deck for an oral course, paired with an 'Advanced Search Techniques Examples' file.

**Although having commonalities, both tutorials cover Elasticsearch from different view points and are designed to complete each other.**
