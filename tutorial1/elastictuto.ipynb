    "The **Elastic Stack**, formerly known as the ELK Stack, is a powerful combination of open-source tools that includes **Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, **Kibana**, and additional components like Beats and Elasticsearch's Machine Learning. It is widely used for centralized logging, log analysis, and data visualization. While this tutorial focuses on teaching the basics of Elasticsearch and does not cover the entire Elastic Stack, we will deploy the Elastic Stack using Docker containers for two main reasons:\n",
    "- **Simplified Configuration**: Deploying Elasticsearch locally can involve complex configurations and dependencies. By running it inside a container, we can abstract away these configuration details, allowing us to focus solely on the basics of Elasticsearch that we aim to cover in this tutorial.\n",
    "- **Preparation for Future Tutorials**: While Elasticsearch alone would be sufficient for our tutorial, deploying the entire Elastic Stack provides an opportunity for readers to familiarize themselves with the stack's deployment process. This prepares them to explore further tutorials on the Elastic Stack after gaining a solid understanding of Elasticsearch, which we recommend.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, we will still use **Kibana** during this tutorial. Most specifically, the **Dev Tools**, which offers a convenient interface for querying Elasticsearch nodes. This feature will enhance our learning experience and enable us to interact effectively with Elasticsearch."
